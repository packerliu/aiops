# EECS 399-235: Network Dataset Creation and Collection

In order to utilize the machine learning to build a self-operating network, we need a dataset to purposely train ML models to capture network features and behaviors. 
This directed study will guide students with background of computer network to automatically create such a dataset of computer networks with various features so that these data can be trained and encoded to eventually predict network issues or generate desired networking features.  

This would eventually help us to build a self-operating network, that should have the capability of network automation in three phases of plan, build and run in the life cycles of the network infrastructure. 
Various open source and commercial tools such as [GNS3](http://www.gns3.com), [BatFish](https://batfish.org/), [Metha](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/birkner), [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Forward Networks](https://www.forwardnetworks.com/) will be used and the programming in Python, C/C++ and JavaScript are required to automate the network creation, data collection and visualization.

Once a dataset is ready, we could utilize the ML models, to train on the obtained dataset and eventually build up capabilities for network prediction and generation.  This section of the research might requires students to have knowledge of machine learning related course works. 

The research project requires the student to work at about 4 hours per week during the semester including meeting, discussions, self-paced study and programming. The source code and documents will be committed in an open source project.  The final delivery also include a technical report that can be a foundation to turn any innovation into a manuscript and submit to a technical conference.  

A more detailed [roadmap](roadmap.md) would be continuously developed and used to guide this study.
